# Aurora 

A  http client and dump server, with emphasies on documentation

## Language.

Javascript/Reason/Typescript (front end)
Kotlin.(backend)

## Frame works.

1. Server ktor.
2. React(Javascript).

## Getting started

1.  Client

       The application front end.
       composed of two main items ie app & modules.
       *    app -> this is the app that working changes go into,its the main app.Testing , development and production will be based on this app.
       *    Components -> made of pieces that are used to expeirment components that will go into the main app.Also it holds the app theme template & the customized target template(waay long term thingy).

2.  Server

       The server end of the application.
       its basically a webserver in kotlin
<br>
<br>

use intellij or any like ide to load the `server folder` and user any text editor to edit the `client/app` folder.
 
In the client run `yarn install` to install dependancies
then `yarn app` or `yarn start` to run the electron app.

On the server run `./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies` to get depedancies then to run the server `./gradlew --run` .
