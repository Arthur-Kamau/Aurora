```{{#repeat count [comma=true]}} ... {{/repeat}}```

* `count` The number of times to repeat the content (required)
* `comma` Adds or removes the separating comma between blocks of content (optional, default is true)

Repeats blocks of content, similar to Handlebars built-in `each`. 
Can be used anywhere in your template, not just inside arrays. 
Automatically adds a comma and line break between blocks
